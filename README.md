In this study, we investigated factors associated with impactful scientific
publications funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the field of
cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We analyzed a database of NIH-funded heart disease
research publications from 2002 to 2020 to uncover key factors contributing to
successful outcomes in this field. The study found that funding provided by the NIH
positively correlated with the number of publications, and spending cuts in scientific
research by the US Congress are associated with research productivity. Our exploratory
data analysis revealed the concentration of heart disease research articles in a small
number of journals and institutions. We observed gender disparities, with a higher
representation of male first authors in top journals and institutions. We demonstrated
that male-authored publications received more citations and had higher NIH Percentile
scores compared to female-authored publications, indicating a persistent gender gap in
publication and visibility. The study also employed predictive modeling, where
regression models initially performed poorly, but the XGBoosting model demonstrated
the best predictive power among classifiers in estimating the success of cardiovascular
research. We defined the success of a publication as the number of people who benefit
from the published research and we employed the NIH Percentile as an approximation
of that measure. Journal Rank emerged as the most influential feature in predicting
research success. Overall, this study provides important insights into the factors
influencing impactful publications in the field of heart disease research, including
funding, journal selection, institutional affiliations, gender disparities, and the potential
for predicting research success.
